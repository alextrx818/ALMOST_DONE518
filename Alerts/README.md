# Alerts Subsystem

This document describes the design, configuration, and extension points for the Alert Branch of the sportsâ€‘bot project. It is intended for developers integrating new alert scanners (satellites) or maintaining the central alert orchestration (AlerterMain).

## 1. Overview

The Alert Branch runs in parallel with the main fetch/merge/summary pipeline. Its responsibilities are strictly:

- **Detection**: each satellite scanner examines one match's data and signals when its specific criteria are met.
- **Orchestration**: AlerterMain manages scanner discovery, deduplication, formatting, logging, and notifications (e.g., Telegram).

No scanning logic lives in the main orchestrator; all domainâ€‘specific criteria are contained in satellite classes under `Alerts/`.

## 2. Architecture & Data Flow

**Core Pipeline** (`orchestrate_complete.py`):
1. Fetch â†’ Merge â†’ Write Combined Summaries â†’ Generate Summary JSON
2. Calls `run_alerters(summary_json, match_ids)` immediately after JSON generation.

**AlerterMain** (`Alerts/alerter_main.py`):
1. Discovers all BaseAlert subclasses.
2. Iterates over `summary_json['matches']`, invoking each scanner via `safe_check(match)`.
3. On positive payloads, applies dedup logic, formats the alert, logs it, and sends notifications.

**Satellite Scanners** (`Alerts/*.py`, e.g. `OU3.py`):
1. Inherit from BaseAlert.
2. Implement only a `check(match)` method that returns a structured payload or None.

## 3. BaseAlert: Core Interface

**Location**: `Alerts/base_alert.py`

**Responsibilities**:
- **Interface**: defines `check(match)` signature.
- **Error Safety**: wraps calls in `safe_check()` to catch exceptions and log errors without crashing.
- **Logging**: each scanner gets its own named logger from the base class.

**Key Methods**:
```
Alert(name)
    â””â”€â”€ constructor: set humanâ€‘readable name and logger.
check(match)
    â””â”€â”€ abstract: called by satellites for detection logic.
safe_check(match)
    â””â”€â”€ wrapper: try/catch around check(), logs on error, returns None on exception.
```

## 4. Implementing a Satellite Scanner

To add a new alert scanner:

1. Create a new file under `Alerts/`, e.g. `my_event_alert.py`.
2. Define a class that extends `Alert`:
   - Call `super().__init__(name="MyAlertName")` in `__init__`.
   - Implement `check(self, match) -> None | dict`:
     - Inspect fields in the match dict (status_id, score, odds, env, etc.).
     - Return a descriptive dict payload when criteria are met, else None.
3. Drop the file into `Alerts/`â€”no changes to other code required.

**Example Implementation**:

```python
# Alerts/goal_alert.py
from typing import Dict, Optional, Any
from .base_alert import Alert

class GoalAlert(Alert):
    """Alert when a match reaches a certain number of goals."""
    
    def __init__(self, min_goals: int = 3):
        super().__init__(name="GoalAlert")
        self.min_goals = min_goals
        
    def check(self, match: Dict[str, Any]) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Check if total goals meets or exceeds threshold."""
        match_id = match.get("match_id", "unknown")
        
        # Extract score information
        score = match.get("score", [])
        if not isinstance(score, list) or len(score) < 4:
            self.logger.debug(f"Match {match_id}: Invalid score format")
            return None
            
        # Extract home and away scores
        home_score = score[2][0] if isinstance(score[2], list) else 0
        away_score = score[3][0] if isinstance(score[3], list) else 0
        
        total_goals = home_score + away_score
        
        # Check if total goals meets threshold
        if total_goals >= self.min_goals:
            self.logger.info(f"Match {match_id}: Total goals {total_goals} meets threshold {self.min_goals}")
            return {
                "type": "GOAL",
                "total_goals": total_goals,
                "threshold": self.min_goals,
                "detail": f"Total Goals: {total_goals} (Threshold: {self.min_goals})"
            }
            
        return None
```

## 5. Autoâ€‘Discovery & Registration

AlerterMain automatically discovers scanners:

1. Scans the `Alerts/` directory (excluding `__init__.py`, `alerter_main.py`, `base_alert.py`).
2. Imports each module dynamically.
3. Finds all classes that subclass `Alert`.
4. Instantiates them, using parameters from an optional `alert_params` map.

This mechanism frees you from maintaining a manual list: new scanners are live by file presence.

## 6. Pipeline Integration

**Entry Point**: `run_alerters(summary_json, match_ids)` in the orchestrator.

Inside it:
1. Instantiate `AlerterMain(auto_discover=True, alert_params=...)`.
2. Log how many matches and alerts will run.
3. Loop over `summary_json['matches']`, retrieving `match_id` for dedup.
4. Invoke each scanner via `notice = alert.safe_check(match)`.
5. If notice and not already seen:
   - Add to seenâ€‘IDs.
   - Format, log, and notify.

No scanner or format code resides in the orchestratorâ€”everything routes through AlerterMain.

## 7. Configuration & Parameters

Default thresholds and other perâ€‘alert settings live in the orchestrator's `alert_params` dict.

**Example**:
```python
alert_params = {
    "OverUnderAlert": {"threshold": 3.5},
    "GoalAlert": {"min_goals": 2}
}
```

Pass `alert_params` to AlerterMain to customize each scanner's constructor args.

## 8. Logging, Formatting & State

**Perâ€‘Alert Logs**: each scanner has a dedicated `.logger` file under `Alerts/` via `configure_alert_logger()`.

**Seenâ€‘IDs Persistence**: for each alert, a `<AlertName>.seen.json` file stores match IDs already notified, preventing duplicates across runs.

**Formatting**: AlerterMain's `format_alert(match, payload, alert_type)` produces a consistent, pretty-printed multiâ€‘line message matching the combined-summary style.

## 9. Error Handling

**Isolation**: any exception in a scanner's `check()` is caught by `safe_check()`, logged with stack trace, and treated as "no alert."

**Discovery Failures**: modules or classes that fail to import/instantiate during discovery are logged but do not halt the pipeline.

**Notification Errors**: failures sending to Telegram (or other channels) are logged but do not crash the service.

## 10. Extending the System

To add or modify alerts:

1. Drop a new Python file in `Alerts/` implementing the `Alert` interface.
2. Define your criteria in `check(match)`, returning None or a payload dict.
3. (Optional) Add constructor parameters to `alert_params` in the orchestrator if needed.
4. Run the pipelineâ€”your new alert will be auto-registered and active immediately.

No changes to the main orchestrator or existing alert code are required.

## 11. Troubleshooting & FAQs

- **My alert isn't running**: ensure your class inherits `Alert`, file name ends with `.py`, and you didn't exclude it in discovery patterns.
- **Parameters not applied**: verify `alert_params` uses the exact class name key.
- **Duplicate notifications**: check that your payload includes no changing fields (e.g. timestamps) so dedup IDs match.
- **Formatting looks off**: confirm `format_match_summary()` outputs the expected lines and `format_alert()` inserts payload details in the right place.

Now you have a fullyâ€‘global, pluginâ€‘style alert framework: the main pipeline just hands off data, AlerterMain orchestrates, and satellite classes implement detection. Drop in new scanners freely, and maintain only the `alert_params` map for customization.

Happy alerting! ðŸŽ‰
