- **`tests/smoke_tests.py`** (minor changes)
  - Lines 25-30: Using centralized logger factories
  - Lines 35-40: Removed direct logger instantiation

## 3. Files Deleted

### 3.1 Backup Files (.bak)
- **All `*.bak` files** - Removed after standardization was complete:
  - `Alerts/*.bak` - Old alert system implementations with direct logging
  - `log_config.py.bak` - Previous version before standardization
  - `merged_logic.py.bak` - Old implementation with custom formatters
  - `pure_json_fetch_cache.py.bak` - Previous caching implementation
  - `orchestrate_complete.py.bak` - Old orchestration file
  - `test_*.bak` - Various test files before standardization

### 3.2 Service Related
- **`debug_env.sh`** - Replaced by more comprehensive diagnostic tools
- **`football_bot.service`** - Replaced by improved service implementation
- **`football_bot.timer`** - No longer needed with continuous operation model
- **`football_bot_fixed.service`** - Consolidated into main service
- **`football_bot_oneshot.service`** - Consolidated into main service

## 4. Implementation Architecture

### 4.1 Five-Layer Enforcement
- **Layer 1: Runtime Enforcement** (lines 52-85 in `log_config.py`)
  - Monkey-patches `get_logger()`
  - Implements `CentralLogger` class

- **Layer 2: Static Analysis** (via `tools/enforce_logging_standards.py`)
  - Runs grep-based checks
  - Identifies non-compliant logging code

- **Layer 3: Git Pre-commit Hook** (`.githooks/pre-commit`)
  - Activates static analysis on every commit attempt
  - Prevents non-compliant code from being committed

- **Layer 4: Validation Functions** (lines 580-849 in `log_config.py`)
  - Multiple validation functions for different aspects of logging
  - Comprehensive checks for consistency and standards

- **Layer 5: Centralized Configuration** (via `configure_logging()`)
  - Called at application startup
  - Applies consistent configuration to all loggers

### 4.2 Standardized Usage Pattern
```python
# line 37-38: Import the factory method
from log_config import get_logger

# line 40-41: Create a standardized logger
logger = get_logger("module_name")

# line 43-44: For summary loggers, use the specialized factory
from log_config import get_summary_logger
summary_logger = get_summary_logger("pipeline")
```

## 5. Summary of Improvements

- **Standardized Logging**: All logger creation now uses factory methods
- **Centralized Configuration**: All configuration in `log_config.py`
- **Automated Enforcement**: Pre-commit hooks prevent non-compliant code
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Test coverage for strict and non-strict modes
- **Clear Documentation**: Detailed documentation with code examples
- **Automated Setup**: `setup_hooks.sh` for easy repository setup
- **Runtime Protection**: Monkey-patching protects against accidental violations
- **Enhanced Validation**: Comprehensive validation functions for runtime checks
