# Alert Skeleton Structure Creation

This README outlines the high-level notes to embed into your code and the natural-language commands to instruct your AI coding agent to implement each step of the alert subsystem.

---

## 1. In `Alerts/base_alert.py`

**Note to insert at the very top (under the docstring):**

```python
# NOTE FOR AI BOT:
# To create a new alert scanner, simply drop a .py file in this Alerts/ folder,
# define a class that subclasses Alert, and implement check(match). No other
# files need touching—you'll be auto‑discovered.
```

**Command to your coding agent:**

```
"In Alerts/base_alert.py, add the above NOTE FOR AI BOT comment under the module docstring."
```

---

## 2. In `Alerts/alerter_main.py`

**Note to insert in the `discover_alerts` docstring (or immediately above it):**

```python
# NOTE FOR AI BOT:
# This method auto‑discovers all subclasses of Alert—you never need to
# manually import or list them. If you drop a new scanner here, it'll be
# picked up automatically.
```

**Note to insert at the top of `__init__`:**

```python
# NOTE FOR AI BOT:
# After discovery, we must initialize each alert: set up per‑alert log files
# and load its <AlertName>.seen.json state. See _initialize_alert() below.
```

**Command to your coding agent:**

```
"In alerter_main.py, add the two NOTE FOR AI BOT comments—one above discover_alerts() and one at the top of __init__(). Then implement a private helper _initialize_alert(self, alert) that encapsulates the old file‑base / seen‑IDs logic, and call _initialize_alert(alert) for each alert immediately after instantiation in __init__. Keep the rest of the constructor intact."
```

---

## 3. In `orchestrate_complete.py`

**Note to insert just above the call to `run_alerters(...)`:**

```python
# NOTE FOR AI BOT:
# This is the single entry point for alerts in the main pipeline.
# Do not invoke AlerterMain.run() here—always call run_alerters(summary_json, match_ids).
```

**Note to insert just above the `alert_params = {...}` block:**

```python
# NOTE FOR AI BOT:
# Alert parameters come from Alerts/alerts_config.py.
# Load them here instead of hard‑coding values.
```

**Command to your coding agent:**

```
"In orchestrate_complete.py, add those two NOTE FOR AI BOT comments. Then replace the hard‑coded alert_params = {...} literal by importing a new alerts_config.py (or .json) from the Alerts folder and using its ALERT_PARAMS mapping. Remove any direct references to AlerterMain.run(), leaving only run_alerters(). Ensure run_alerters() still passes through the loaded config."
```

---

## 4. Create `Alerts/alerts_config.py`

**File contents sketch:**

```python
# alerts_config.py – Centralized alert parameters

# Example:
ALERT_PARAMS = {
    "OverUnderAlert": {"threshold": 3.0},
    # Add other alerts here as you create them:
    # "MyNewAlert": {"paramA": "foo", "paramB": 42},
}
```

**Command to your coding agent:**

```
"Add a new file Alerts/alerts_config.py containing an ALERT_PARAMS dict. Then update discover_alerts() to merge each class's optional DEFAULT_PARAMS with ALERT_PARAMS.get(class_name, {}), instantiating each alert with those merged settings—skipping or logging any instantiation errors without crashing."
```

---

## 5. Enhance `Alert` base class for optional debug logging

**Pseudocode to add in `base_alert.py` constructor:**

```python
def __init__(self, name: str, debug: bool = False):
    self.name = name
    self.logger = get_logger(name)
    if debug:
        handler = logging.FileHandler(Path(__file__).parent / f"{name}_debug.log")
        handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
        handler.setFormatter(
            logging.Formatter("%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s")
        )
        self.logger.addHandler(handler)
        self.logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

**Command to your coding agent:**

```
"Modify the Alert.__init__ signature to accept debug=False. If debug is true, add a DEBUG‑level file handler named <AlertName>_debug.log with a standard timestamped formatter. Do not change any satellite code except to pass debug=True where needed."
```

---

### Final Integration Checklist

1. **Insert Notes**: Embed each "NOTE FOR AI BOT" comment in the three code files above.
2. **\_initialize\_alert Helper**: Create and call this to restore per‑alert file‑base & seen‑IDs logic.
3. **Deprecate run()**: Remove or mark `AlerterMain.run()` as deprecated, keeping only `run_alerters()`.
4. **Config File**: Add `Alerts/alerts_config.py` and wire it into `discover_alerts()`.
5. **Debug Handler**: Update `base_alert.py` to accept a `debug` flag and optionally attach a file handler.

Follow these commands in order to set up a robust, self‑documenting, auto‑discovering alert skeleton for your AI coding agent. Happy coding!

# Alerts Subsystem: Comprehensive Guide

This document captures every step we've taken to build a flexible, scalable alerting branch in the sports bot, and shows exactly how to add new alert "satellites" in the future. If you ever need to reconstruct the system from scratch, just follow these steps in order.

## 1. Architectural Overview

### Orchestrator Pipeline

- **Fetch & Cache → Merge & Enrich → Print Human Summaries → Generate JSON → Run Alerts**
- Alerts run on the in-memory JSON immediately after it's written, using the same ordered match list that was printed.

### Alert Branch

- **AlerterMain**: central coordinator—no detection logic, only discovery, deduplication, formatting, logging, and notification.
- **BaseAlert (abstract)**: defines a safe interface every detector must follow.
- **Satellite Alerts** (e.g. OverUnderAlert): simply implement check(match) and declare defaults; everything else is wired up for them.

### Auto-Discovery & Configuration

- All subclasses of Alert in Alerts/ are discovered at runtime—no manual imports.
- Parameters (thresholds, etc.) come from a single source of truth: Alerts/alerts_config.py, merged with any DEFAULT_PARAMS defined in the class.

### Logging & State

- Each alert gets its own log file (<AlertName>.logger) and a dedup store (<AlertName>.seen.json).
- File handlers and seen-ID loading are encapsulated in a private _initialize_alert() helper.

## 2. Foundational Steps (What We Did First)

### Create BaseAlert (Alerts/base_alert.py)

- Defined abstract Alert class with:
  - **__init__(name, debug=False)**
    - Configures a logger for this alert.
    - Optionally adds a debug-level file handler.
  - **check(match)** (abstract)
  - **safe_check(match)** wrapper to catch exceptions and log them without crashing the pipeline.
- Added a top-of-file "NOTE FOR AI BOT" comment to guide future alert creation.

### Refactor Existing Satellites

- Updated OU3.py to subclass Alert.
- Removed its own handler setup—now uses self.logger.
- Stubbed in DEFAULT_PARAMS = {"threshold": 3.0}.

### Auto-Discovery (Alerts/alerter_main.py)

- Added discover_alerts() class method:
  - Scans Alerts/ folder for Python files.
  - Dynamically imports each module.
  - Finds classes inheriting from Alert.
  - Merges DEFAULT_PARAMS with the central ALERT_PARAMS.
  - Instantiates each alert.
- Updated __init__ to call discovery, then _initialize_alert() for each instance.
- Moved all per-alert logger/seen-ID setup into _initialize_alert().

### Central Config (Alerts/alerts_config.py)

- Created a simple ALERT_PARAMS dictionary—maps class names to parameter dicts.
- Orchestrator loads this file and passes it into AlerterMain.

### Orchestrator Hook (orchestrate_complete.py)

- Replaced hard-coded alert instantiation with call to run_alerters().
- Added "NOTE FOR AI BOT" markers so any developer knows:
  - This is the single alerts entry point.
  - Alert parameters are sourced from alerts_config.py.

## 3. Adding a New Alert Scanner

When you need to introduce a new alert (e.g. HighScoringAlert), follow these steps:

### Create File

- Path: Alerts/HighScoringAlert.py

### Subclass BaseAlert

```python
from .base_alert import Alert

class HighScoringAlert(Alert):
    DEFAULT_PARAMS = {"goal_threshold": 3}

    def __init__(self, goal_threshold=None):
        super().__init__(name="HighScoring", debug=False)
        self.goal_threshold = goal_threshold or self.DEFAULT_PARAMS["goal_threshold"]

    def check(self, match):
        # Your detection logic here...
        # Return None or a dict payload if triggered
```

### Add Configuration (optional override)

- Open Alerts/alerts_config.py
- Add:
  ```python
  ALERT_PARAMS["HighScoringAlert"] = {"goal_threshold": 4}
  ```

### Run Pipeline

- On next execution, AlerterMain.discover_alerts() will automatically pick up HighScoringAlert.
- It will log discovery, instantiate with merged params, initialize its log file and seen-IDs, and run its safe_check() on every match.

## 4. How Alerts Are Processed

### Pipeline calls

```python
summary_json = write_summary_json(merged_data)
await run_alerters(summary_json, match_ids)
```

### run_alerters

- Instantiates AlerterMain(auto_discover=True, alert_params=ALERT_PARAMS).
- Logs how many alerts were discovered.
- Loops through each match in summary_json['matches']:
  - For each alert in alerter.alerts, calls alert.safe_check(match).
  - If payload returned and match_id not in its seen list:
    - Logs the trigger, formats with alerter.format_alert(), sends notifications, writes to <AlertName>.logger, and marks it as seen.

### Deduplication

- Once an alert fires on a match, that match_id is added to <AlertName>.seen.json.
- The same alert will not fire again for that match—unless you manually clear the file.

## 5. OverUnderAlert Implementation

In Alerts/OU3.py, your check(match) should:

### Filter by live play

```python
status = int(match.get("status_id", 0))
if status not in {2, 3, 4}:  # first half, half-time, second half
    return None
```

### Extract O/U map

```python
ou_map = match.get("odds", {}).get("over_under", {})
if not ou_map:
    return None
```

### Pick latest entry

```python
latest = max(ou_map.values(), key=lambda e: e.get("timestamp", 0))
line = float(latest.get("line", 0))
```

### Threshold check

```python
if line <= self.threshold:
    return None
```

### Return payload

```python
return {
  "type": self.name,
  "line": line,
  "over": float(latest.get("over", 0)),
  "under": float(latest.get("under", 0)),
  "threshold": self.threshold,
  "timestamp": latest["timestamp"],
  "detail": f"Over/Under Line: {line:.2f}"
}
```

## 6. Recovery & Rebuild Instructions

If the machine reboots or the project is wiped, do the following in order:

1. Clone repo → cd football/main
2. Ensure log_config.py has the timezone converter and PrependFileHandler adjustments.
3. Ensure Alerts/base_alert.py and alerter_main.py exist with the auto-discovery and _initialize_alert logic.
4. Ensure Alerts/alerts_config.py defines ALERT_PARAMS.
5. Ensure OU3.py (and any other satellites) subclass Alert and define DEFAULT_PARAMS + check().
6. Restart pipeline via run_pipeline.sh.
   - You should see console summaries, then logs in logs/, then alerts firing based on your new scanner.
7. Verify
   - Check combined_match_summary.logger for summary output.
   - Check summary_json.logger for JSON prepends.
   - Check Alerts/*.logger for any alert triggers.
   - Check Alerts/*.seen.json to confirm dedup IDs.

With this document, you have a step-by-step record of how we built the alert fork, established the foundation, and how to keep adding new detectors seamlessly. Happy alerting!

# Alerts Subsystem

This document describes the design, configuration, and extension points for the Alert Branch of the sports‑bot project. It is intended for developers integrating new alert scanners (satellites) or maintaining the central alert orchestration (AlerterMain).

11. [Troubleshooting & FAQs](#11-troubleshooting--faqs)

## 1. Overview

The Alert Branch runs in parallel with the main fetch/merge/summary pipeline. Its responsibilities are strictly:

- **Detection**: each satellite scanner examines one match's data and signals when its specific criteria are met.
- **Orchestration**: AlerterMain manages scanner discovery, deduplication, formatting, logging, and notifications (e.g., Telegram).

No scanning logic lives in the main orchestrator; all domain‑specific criteria are contained in satellite classes under `Alerts/`.

## 2. Architecture & Data Flow

**Core Pipeline** (`orchestrate_complete.py`):
1. Fetch → Merge → Write Combined Summaries → Generate Summary JSON
2. Calls `run_alerters(summary_json, match_ids)` immediately after JSON generation.

**AlerterMain** (`Alerts/alerter_main.py`):
1. Discovers all BaseAlert subclasses.
2. Iterates over `summary_json['matches']`, invoking each scanner via `safe_check(match)`.
3. On positive payloads, applies dedup logic, formats the alert, logs it, and sends notifications.

**Satellite Scanners** (`Alerts/*.py`, e.g. `OU3.py`):
1. Inherit from BaseAlert.
2. Implement only a `check(match)` method that returns a structured payload or None.

## 3. BaseAlert: Core Interface

**Location**: `Alerts/base_alert.py`

**Responsibilities**:
- **Interface**: defines `check(match)` signature.
- **Error Safety**: wraps calls in `safe_check()` to catch exceptions and log errors without crashing.
- **Logging**: each scanner gets its own named logger from the base class.

**Key Methods**:
```
Alert(name)
    └── constructor: set human‑readable name and logger.
check(match)
    └── abstract: called by satellites for detection logic.
safe_check(match)
    └── wrapper: try/catch around check(), logs on error, returns None on exception.
```

## 4. Implementing a Satellite Scanner

To add a new alert scanner:

1. Create a new file under `Alerts/`, e.g. `my_event_alert.py`.
2. Define a class that extends `Alert`:
   - Call `super().__init__(name="MyAlertName")` in `__init__`.
   - Implement `check(self, match) -> None | dict`:
     - Inspect fields in the match dict (status_id, score, odds, env, etc.).
     - Return a descriptive dict payload when criteria are met, else None.
3. Drop the file into `Alerts/`—no changes to other code required.

**Example Implementation**:

```python
# Alerts/goal_alert.py
from typing import Dict, Optional, Any
from .base_alert import Alert

class GoalAlert(Alert):
    """Alert when a match reaches a certain number of goals."""
    
    def __init__(self, min_goals: int = 3):
        super().__init__(name="GoalAlert")
        self.min_goals = min_goals
        
    def check(self, match: Dict[str, Any]) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Check if total goals meets or exceeds threshold."""
        match_id = match.get("match_id", "unknown")
        
        # Extract score information
        score = match.get("score", [])
        if not isinstance(score, list) or len(score) < 4:
            self.logger.debug(f"Match {match_id}: Invalid score format")
            return None
            
        # Extract home and away scores
        home_score = score[2][0] if isinstance(score[2], list) else 0
        away_score = score[3][0] if isinstance(score[3], list) else 0
        
        total_goals = home_score + away_score
        
        # Check if total goals meets threshold
        if total_goals >= self.min_goals:
            self.logger.info(f"Match {match_id}: Total goals {total_goals} meets threshold {self.min_goals}")
            return {
                "type": "GOAL",
                "total_goals": total_goals,
                "threshold": self.min_goals,
                "detail": f"Total Goals: {total_goals} (Threshold: {self.min_goals})"
            }
            
        return None
```

## 5. Auto‑Discovery & Registration

AlerterMain automatically discovers scanners:

1. Scans the `Alerts/` directory (excluding `__init__.py`, `alerter_main.py`, `base_alert.py`).
2. Imports each module dynamically.
3. Finds all classes that subclass `Alert`.
4. Instantiates them, using parameters from an optional `alert_params` map.

This mechanism frees you from maintaining a manual list: new scanners are live by file presence.

## 6. Pipeline Integration

**Entry Point**: `run_alerters(summary_json, match_ids)` in the orchestrator.

Inside it:
1. Instantiate `AlerterMain(auto_discover=True, alert_params=...)`.
2. Log how many matches and alerts will run.
3. Loop over `summary_json['matches']`, retrieving `match_id` for dedup.
4. Invoke each scanner via `notice = alert.safe_check(match)`.
5. If notice and not already seen:
   - Add to seen‑IDs.
   - Format, log, and notify.

No scanner or format code resides in the orchestrator—everything routes through AlerterMain.

## 7. Configuration & Parameters

Default thresholds and other per‑alert settings live in the orchestrator's `alert_params` dict.

**Example**:
```python
alert_params = {
    "OverUnderAlert": {"threshold": 3.5},
    "GoalAlert": {"min_goals": 2}
}
```

Pass `alert_params` to AlerterMain to customize each scanner's constructor args.

## 8. Logging, Formatting & State

**Per‑Alert Logs**: each scanner has a dedicated `.logger` file under `Alerts/` via `configure_alert_logger()`.

**Seen‑IDs Persistence**: for each alert, a `<AlertName>.seen.json` file stores match IDs already notified, preventing duplicates across runs.

**Formatting**: AlerterMain's `format_alert(match, payload, alert_type)` produces a consistent, pretty-printed multi‑line message matching the combined-summary style.

## 9. Error Handling

**Isolation**: any exception in a scanner's `check()` is caught by `safe_check()`, logged with stack trace, and treated as "no alert."

**Discovery Failures**: modules or classes that fail to import/instantiate during discovery are logged but do not halt the pipeline.

**Notification Errors**: failures sending to Telegram (or other channels) are logged but do not crash the service.

## 10. Extending the System

To add or modify alerts:

1. Drop a new Python file in `Alerts/` implementing the `Alert` interface.
2. Define your criteria in `check(match)`, returning None or a payload dict.
3. (Optional) Add constructor parameters to `alert_params` in the orchestrator if needed.
4. Run the pipeline—your new alert will be auto-registered and active immediately.

No changes to the main orchestrator or existing alert code are required.

## 11. Troubleshooting & FAQs

- **My alert isn't running**: ensure your class inherits `Alert`, file name ends with `.py`, and you didn't exclude it in discovery patterns.
- **Parameters not applied**: verify `alert_params` uses the exact class name key.
- **Duplicate notifications**: check that your payload includes no changing fields (e.g. timestamps) so dedup IDs match.
- **Formatting looks off**: confirm `format_match_summary()` outputs the expected lines and `format_alert()` inserts payload details in the right place.

Now you have a fully‑global, plugin‑style alert framework: the main pipeline just hands off data, AlerterMain orchestrates, and satellite classes implement detection. Drop in new scanners freely, and maintain only the `alert_params` map for customization.

Happy alerting! 🎉

## Overview

**IMPORTANT: Refer to this README whenever exploring, modifying, or extending the alert system.**

The Alert Subsystem is a modular, plugin-based framework designed to scan enriched match data for user-defined conditions ("alerts"). It sits downstream of the core sports-data pipeline and upstream of user notifications/logging. New alert "satellites" can be dropped into the system without modifying core orchestration logic.

### Goals

- **Separation of Concerns**: Detection logic (satellites) vs orchestration & notification (AlerterMain).
- **Auto‑Discovery**: New alert classes are auto‑loaded from the Alerts/ folder.
- **Safe Execution**: Satellite failures do not crash the pipeline via safe_check().
- **Global Consistency**: Unified timezone, status‑ordering, and logging conventions.
- **Easy Extension**: Developers can add new alerts by subclassing a single base class.

## Architecture & Data Flow

```
merge_all_matches  
      ↓             (sorted by DESIRED_STATUS_ORDER)  
write_combined_match_summary  → human-readable console & file  
      ↓  (unchanged list)  
write_summary_json (produces in-memory dict + prepend‑log)  
      ↓  
run_alerters(summary_json)  → invokes AlerterMain  
      ↓  (auto-discovered Alert instances)  
For each match in summary_json['matches']:
    alert.safe_check(match)  → detection logic
        ↳ None: no alert
        ↳ payload:  dedupe → format_alert() → send_notification() + per-alert log
```

1. **Data Enrichment**: Raw API data → merge_logic → enriched match dicts
2. **Summary Generation**: Formatted human logs, then JSON summaries
3. **Alerter Invocation**: run_alerters hands JSON to AlerterMain
4. **Detection**: BaseAlert.safe_check() calls each satellite's check()
5. **Deduplication**: Each alert writes/reads <AlertName>.seen.json to avoid repeats
6. **Notification & Logging**: Matches that trigger are formatted and sent/logged

## Key Components

### 1. BaseAlert (Alerts/base_alert.py)

Abstract Class requiring:

- **__init__(self, name: str, debug: bool=False)** — registers a per-alert logger, optional debug file handler.
- **check(self, match: Dict) -> Optional[Union[str, Dict]]** — must be implemented by satellites.
- **safe_check(self, match)** — wraps check() in try/catch, logs exceptions, and returns None on error.

**Usage Note for AI Bot**: At top of file, a comment instructs: "Drop new .py in Alerts/, subclass Alert, implement check(match)."

### 2. Alert Configuration (Alerts/alerts_config.py)

Holds a centralized ALERT_PARAMS mapping:

```python
ALERT_PARAMS = {
    "OverUnderAlert": {"threshold": 3.0},
    # "MyNewAlert": { ... }
}
```

Enables changing parameters without code edits.

### 3. AlerterMain (Alerts/alerter_main.py)

- **Auto‑Discovery**: discover_alerts() scans all .py files (except __init__, main, base) for subclasses of Alert.
- **Initialization**: After discovery, _initialize_alert(alert) sets up file-base → per-alert logger → loads .seen.json.
- **Execution**: No longer uses legacy run(); instead, run_alerters() from the orchestrator drives alerts.
- **Formatting**: Uses format_alert(match, payload, alert.name) to produce consistent multi-line messages.

### 4. Orchestrator Integration (orchestrate_complete.py)

- **Singleton Entry**: run_alerters(summary_json, match_ids) is the single alert hook, after write_summary_json.
- **Configuration Loading**: Imports ALERT_PARAMS from Alerts/alerts_config.py instead of in‑lining.
- **Command Note for AI Bot**: Inline comments mark this as the only alert invocation point.

### 5. Satellite Scanner (e.g., Alerts/OU3.py)

- **Inheritance**: class OverUnderAlert(Alert) with DEFAULT_PARAMS = {"threshold":3.0}.
- **Detection (check)**:
  - Converts match['status_id'] → int, skips if not in {2,3,4}.
  - Reads ou_map = match.get('odds', {}).get('over_under', {}).
  - Finds the entry with the highest timestamp.
  - Checks if line > self.threshold.
  - Returns a payload dict containing type, line, over, under, threshold, timestamp, detail or None.
- **Safe Execution**: All exceptions are caught by base_alert.safe_check().

## Creating a New Alert Satellite

### File Placement
- Alerts/MyNewAlert.py

### Subclass BaseAlert

```python
from .base_alert import Alert

class MyNewAlert(Alert):
    DEFAULT_PARAMS = {"paramA": 42}  # optional defaults

    def __init__(self, paramA=None, debug=False):
        super().__init__(name="MyNewAlert", debug=debug)
        self.paramA = paramA or self.DEFAULT_PARAMS["paramA"]

    def check(self, match):
        # Your detection logic, e.g.:
        if match.get('score', {}).get('home',0) > self.paramA:
            return {"type": self.name, "value": match['score']['home']}
        return None
```

### Configuration
- Add to Alerts/alerts_config.py:

```python
ALERT_PARAMS["MyNewAlert"] = {"paramA": 10}
```

### Auto‑Discovery
- No further imports needed—simply restart the pipeline.

### Test
- Write unit tests under tests/test_mynewalert.py using safe_check.

## Testing & Validation

### Unit Tests (e.g. test_ou3.py)
- Live match above/below threshold
- Non‑live status returns None
- Missing over_under returns None

### Integration
- Run the full pipeline (run_pipeline.sh) and confirm:
  - Alerts fire exactly once per match.
  - .seen.json files populate correctly.
  - Alert logs (Alerts/OU3.logger) contain formatted messages.
  - Telegram messages (if enabled) deliver correctly.

## Next Steps & Completion Criteria

### Finalize OU3 Scanner
- Polish payload (over + under), ensure self.name consistency.

### Complete Unit Tests
- Achieve 100% coverage for all alert logic branches.

### Deprecate Legacy Entry
- Remove or deprecate AlerterMain.run().

### Add CI/CD Checks
- Linting, test runs on PR.

### Document Alerts
- Maintain a registry of available alerts and their parameters.

### When Is This Done?
- All alerts auto-discover, configure, and run without code changes (just adding new files).
- No unhandled exceptions in alert check paths.
- Clear, consistent logs and notifications.
- README and in‑code comments guide new developers end‑to‑end.

## Rebuild Guide

If the alert system needs to be rebuilt from scratch, follow these steps:

1. Create `base_alert.py` with the abstract Alert class implementing `safe_check()`
2. Create `alerts_config.py` with the ALERT_PARAMS dictionary
3. Implement `alerter_main.py` with `discover_alerts()` and `_initialize_alert()` 
4. Modify `orchestrate_complete.py` to import alerts_config and call `run_alerters()`
5. Implement satellite alerts (e.g., OU3.py) by subclassing Alert
6. Add unit tests for each alert satellite

Following this guide, you should be able to reconstruct the entire alert system with the same architecture and functionality.

# TEMPORARY DEVELOPER NOTE - ARCHITECTURAL CHANGES (2025-05-15)            #
############################################################################
# Recent changes to the alerting system:                                   #
#                                                                          #
# 1. SEPARATION OF CONCERNS:                                               #
#    - Individual alerters (like OU3.py) now ONLY handle detection logic   #
#    - They return raw data (as dict) instead of formatted messages        #
#    - AlerterMain now handles ALL formatting through format_alert()       #
#                                                                          #
# 2. ALERT DATA FORMAT:                                                    #
#    - Alerters now return structured data like:                           #
#      {                                                                   #
#        "type": "OU3",                                                   #
#        "value": 3.5,                                                    #
#        "threshold": 3.0,                                                #
#        "detail": "Over/Under Line: 3.50"                                #
#      }                                                                   #
#                                                                          #
# 3. CONSISTENT FORMATTING:                                                #
#    - All alerts now use format_match_summary() from format_utils         #
#    - This ensures consistent pretty-printing across all alert types      #
#    - The formatting matches combined_match_summary.logger                #
#                                                                          #
# 4. BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY:                                               #
#    - format_alert() can handle both new dict-based and old string alerts #
#    - This allows gradual migration of other alerters to the new pattern  #
#                                                                          #

# base_alert.py - Abstract base class for all alert satellites
#
# IMPORTANT: Before modifying this file or creating new alerts, refer to:
#   /Alerts/README_ALERT_SUBSYSTEM.md for complete architecture documentation
"""
This module defines the abstract base class that all alert satellites must extend.

Key features:
1. Standardized interface for all alerts through the abstract check() method
2. Centralized error handling via the safe_check() wrapper
3. Consistent logging through auto-configured loggers
4. Integration with the global timezone and status ordering rules

To create a new alert satellite:
1. Create a new file in the Alerts directory (e.g., my_alert.py)
2. Define a class that extends Alert 
3. Implement the required check(match) method
4. The alert will be auto-discovered and integrated into the pipeline

Example:
    class MyNewAlert(Alert):
        def __init__(self, some_param=default_value):
            super().__init__(name="MyAlert")
            self.some_param = some_param

            return None
"""

# NOTE FOR AI BOT:
# To create a new alert scanner, simply drop a .py file in this Alerts/ folder,
# define a class that subclasses Alert, and implement check(match). No other
# files need touching—you'll be auto‐discovered.
